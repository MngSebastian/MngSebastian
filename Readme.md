### 👨‍💻 About me: I am a FullStack Developer with 3+ years of experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Node.js. I have experience working with modern web standards and production-level systems. My top achievements: delivering a job application project leveraging Adzuna API processing over 2000+ job listings. Delivered a stock market project that reports financial data for 5000+ publicly traded companies with state-of-the-art data visualization. 

🛠️ My career path started when I first tried to build a task management application for my brother and me to manage our workflows. I quickly fell in love with programming and building software ever since. JavaScript and the Web promised endless possibilities and intellectual stimulation. I’ve been working on the web ever since, with a focus on full-stack development, web performance, and SAAS products. 

🚀 My personal motto: "Think deeply, code precisely, innovate constantly."
